      <h1>An empty room</h1>
    <p>You wake up in an room, empty save the bed you wake up on. Paint peels in sheets off the walls and ceiling. As you sit up, the bedsprings pop underneath as you swing your legs onto the dirty wooden floor. A single dirty window lets in a faint glow of sunlight filtered through rusted bars. Across from you, a door sits covered in locks. You stand up, dizziness drops you back down. You take another moment to gather yourself. You rub you're hands on your legs and notice something in your pockets. You reach in and pull your fist out. You open your hand and find. You stand up again, this time successfully.Suddenly, the door pops open an inch.<br> Do you:</br></p>

      <h1>Inside</h1>
    <p>You decide to take things slowly. Perhaps getting your bearings will reaveal what brought you here in the first place. You kneel on the floor and look under the bed. Under half and inch of dust, a bronze ring shines out of the darkness. Carefully and quietly, you move the bed to reveal a giant hatch in the floor. The hinges moan slightly as you pull the hatch open. Supporting yourself, you duck your head down. A long corridor lined with bookshelves unfolds before you ending in a set of double doors. Above the doors gleams the words "exit". You hop down clumsily onto the wooden floor with a crash. You hear a commotion from the other end of the corridor; a horrible scratching, clacking sound. Suddenly, you recognize the sound as it's owner comes into sight. It's a dog. A big dog. The largest pitbull you've ever set eyes on. It slides into a bookshelf as it takes the corner, barking, jowls frothing in abject hatred. Quickly it recovers and barrels in your direction, it's eyes narrowing as it bears down upon you.<br>Should you:</br></p>

  <option value="1">Run for the exit</option>

      <h1>Escape</h1>
    <p>You run. And run. And run. But no matter how much you run the dog gets closer and closer. Just as your hand reaches the door handle the dog's jowls wrap around your ankle stopping you dead in you tracks. Suddenly, it's upon you, your arms vainly flailing to protect your face. It's teeth bite into your forearms as you howl in pain. Your foot kicks out, catching the edge of a bookcase. A salvo of heavy books falls upon your attacker burying him as he exhales a sharp yelp. You slowly get up, shaking, holding your bloodied arms. Suddenly the pile of books starts to move as the beast struggles to escape it's temporary prison. You grab the handle and thrust yourself into the blinding sunlight. You feel weightless. Like you're falling. Your eyes adjust to to the light just in time to see the ground rushing up to meet you.  <br>Back to darkness.</br> The next thing you experience is pain, followed by light, and a slow  painful focus. Your hands pick up clumps of sand and bring them closer to your field of vision. You wince in shades of red as you stand up to take in your surroundings. You look up. Far above you a hundred meters, a set of doors lie ajar. You thank your lucky stars at your dumb luck. You suffer a grin sending pain through your jawline. You attempt to take a step but your foot fails to respond, it's steadfast.  You look down. Your ankles are locked firmly in sand. Any movement sinks you deeper into the morass. It quickly swallows your knees, followed by your waist and chest. As the sand pours into your mouth and nose a strange dormant notion surfaces as you suffocate, "Why <i>do</i> kids love cinnamon toast crunch?"</p>

      <h1>Fight</h1>
    <p>You spin around on your heels and lock eyes on the beast, crouching low.  The gap slowly closes as ripple of calm comes over you. The dog gallops towards you, a mass of sinew and tooth. As it leaps into the air, it's jagged mouth reaching for your neck's tender vulnrebilty, you fall into a trance. You slide instantly to the left, as your  left arm scoops around the beasts head. Your right palm presses upon it's shoulder just as it's momentum is about to collide.  Deftly, as one hand pulls, the other pushes, gently seperating the spinal column, and with gentle throbbing pop, a vital dislocation. You spin around channeling the creature's momentum to your side into a dusty bookcase. Reality kicks in and you start shaking. The very thought of hurting a fly sickens you, so how this?  You hear voices and footsteps from where the dog originated and rise to your feet. You run towards the exit. Just before you burst through the doors, you pull a bookcase down to potentially bar your pursuers. Pushing open the doors assaults your eyes with daylight and you blinded for a moment but you keep running regardless. Running, running, running in a world of light. Your eyes adjust just as a dark shape comes into focus. You collide. A man in a dark suit and sunglasses falls to the ground. The pistol he was holding spins on the asphalt. You both sit there on the ground for a moment, looking at each other, and than the gun between you.<br>Should you:</br></p>

      <img class="decision-images" src="img/pistol.png" alt="gun aiming"/>
      <h1>Struggle</h1>
    <p>You lunge for the pistol just as he does the same. Your fingers gently touch the barrel as his grasp for the grip.  His finger slides into the trigger guard as you fumble with the muzzle. Suddenly your eyes sharpen and time seems to slow. You legs twirl beneath you, as the leverage sends your body into the air onto the gun. Your index finger darts out, striking the magazine release. You quickly contort your body as a single shot rings out, coursing up your sleeve skinning your elbow.  The man attempts to fire off a second shot but his efforts are answered with futile clicking.
    Your other arm swings around and with an open palm strikes the center of his chest. Your arms blur as both index fingers connect behind his ears, followed by your thumbs into the sinew in his neck, as your pinkies connect just below his armpits.  His chest heaves as his head swells, blood pressure spilling out of his eyes and ears.  Like waking from a dream, you scream at what your instincts have wrought. The man is still, blood gurgling from his now deflating body.  You're brain cycles through defensive coping mechanisms that aren't available. You realize that any recollection of who you are just isn't there. A wave of nausea hits depriving your stomach of its contents. You brace yourself and slowly get up. It’s only until now that you realize you’re leaning on a car. Not just any car either, <i>thee</i> car: a 1989 jet black ferrari testarossa. You wipe your mouth with your bloodied sleeve and make your way to the driver’s side. The window is open and a set of keys and a rabbit’s foot dangle from the ignition.  For some reason you look around to see if anyone’s watching. A dormant habit from a former life perhaps? The courtyard appears empty. Suddenly, the courtyard is alive with color, as fallen leaves spin in the air heavy with the scent of the ocean. A small gap between a wall of arborvitae reveal a rusty gate that squeaks open just as the breeze quickens.

      <h1>Struggle</h1>
 <p>You summon all the leverage you can and find yourself on top of the man. His hand easily grabs the pistol as he attempts to draw it’s sights towards you. Your hands pin his wrists down, but heyet manages to slowly move the barrel closer and closer.  Suddenly a shot rings out and warmth runs down your neck.  More shots ring out as you smash his hand against the ground, once, twice, three times. As his hand finally releases the pistol your other hand swings down connecting with his jaw. It puts him out. You get up and touch your right ear. Blood. But not much. Seems he grazed your ear. That’s a relief at least.  You pick up the pistol and tuck it into the front of your pants. You crouch down to check the man’s pockets, perhaps he might have some other things you might find useful. <br>Suddenly behind you!</br><br> A loud clang!</br>You spin around, gun drawn. But there’s nothing there save a rusty gate opened by the wind. You suspiciously inch towards the gate, gun ready. The gate opens to a stone stairwell, where beyond lies the endless blue expanse of the ocean. The walkway criss crosses across the stoney hillside terminating at a beach. An anchored sailboat gently bobs at it’s mooring 25 feet from the beach. <br>Should you:</br></p>

      <h1>Drive</h1>
 <p>You quickly hop in the car. The slam the door shut and reach for the keys. Suddenly, the pitbull lunges for the open window, it’s claws scrambling at the door. You turn the keys and the car roars to life, cramming the clutch into first as the car peels out in a cloud of burnt rubber. The dog futilely takes chase slowly becoming smaller in the rearview. You return your attention in front of you, just as you see the fast approaching gate. BAM! Too late. The car slams into the gate splitting the chain link fence in a cloud of sparks.  You continue down the straightaway, carefully listening. The car seems fine. You open her up. A valley opens up below you as you continue going faster. 80. 90. 100. 150. 200. The car responds smoothly.  You pick out a strange sound, and decide to throttle back just a little. It gets louder as the engine gets quieter.  A flapping sound? A tire perhaps? But the car continues run fair. A horror washes over you as you make a dreadful epiphany. It isn’t coming from the car. It’s coming from...Your eyes look over the dash as an attack helicopter swoops overhead to face you.  It’s starboard battery sends a ballistic missile over the drivers side missing by mere inches. You can feel the heat from the blast as the car surfs the impact wave sending the rpm up for a brief moment.<br>Should you:</br></p>

      <h1>Drive.Faster.</h1>
 <p>Screw it you say to yourself and slam the pedal to the floor. The rpms spike as you shift through the gears.  The helicopter fires another missile which you quickly dodge. Even at 250 mph the vehicle responds beautifully. You blow past the chopper, as it spins around to face your back, sending a fresh salvo, all of which miss their mark, blowing craters into space you occupied just moments before.  You crouch low inthe seat peering at the helicopter in your rearview as it fades from sight.  Meanwhile the car continues to accelerate. 400. 450. 500. How is this even possible? The car hums, resonant with harmonics.  Everything around you starts brightening. 600. 650. Sparks fly as everything glows bright, red hot. 750.850. The needle buries. The hum intensifies. The light blinding. Your hands rise to your eyes to shield them from the light but they offer little succour. <br>Suddenly, everything stops and is dark again.</br><br>Should you:</br></p>

      <h1>Open your eyes</h1>
 <p><br>You open your eyes.</br> You look around you. You’re surrounded by dense foliage. Ferns and trees the size of which you’ve never seen before. You hop out of the car, steam curling off the hood.  You land in mud up to you kneecaps. Great. You seem to be in some kind of hole in the ground. The car slowly starts sinking  into the morass as you slowly trudge out of the mud, up towards the giant holes perimeter. Something catches your eye, and a giant shape the size of a motorcycle rips right past, nearly sending you back into the pit.  You squint to attempt to make out what exactly it was. It doubles back towards you. <br>Zoom!</br>You duck just in time to miss it a second time. Yep. Exactly what you thought. A colossal dragonfly. You ready yourself for another pass, but just as it’s circling back, the earth starts shaking. It subsides as quick as it begins. The dragonfly is now nowhere to be seen. The earth shakes again and stops, sending you to your knees. Thump. It happens a third and fourth time as you watch as the top of the ferrari is consumed in mud. Thump. At this point, it dawns on you that this hole isn’t really much of a hole at all. Thump thump. But more of a ….foot print. <br>THUMP!<br>

      <h1>Close your eyes</h1>
 <p><br>You clench your eyes shut.</br>You sit there in muted silence for what seems like an eternity until you hear a sharp rapping on the car window. You open your eyes finally, not that it does you any good, a bright light obfuscates your vision. “Are you alright ma’am?” a voice asks. The light disappears, as the police officer lowers his flashlight. You take in your surroundings.  You’re at the wheel of your car. The front end is wrapped around a pillar of an enormous gate leading to a colossal manse. The gate opens and closes  banging on the front of the vehicle. “I said, are you alright Mrs. Kardashian?” the officer asks again.  A cameraman jumps out of a nearby van.  Suddenly you’re pulled out of the vehicle. A blanket is thrown over your head and you are ushered  inside the mansion. More paparazzi arrive and the night air is alive with the flash of their cameras as the police officer tries to hold them back.  You falter a few times as you’re led up a marble staircase inside.  Finally, you are tucked into a massive bed and exhaustion takes its toll and you collapse into a deep sleep.<br>The years tick by and you grow restless. You look in the mirror at the lifeless mask before you. A lifelong addiction to plastic surgery has turned you into a hideous garish portrait of your former self.  Every once in awhile, during rare gaps in your tightly controlled itinerary, your mind takes you back.  Back to that one moment. The <i>only</i> moment where you can safely say you felt truly alive.  To this day, it still confuses you. It felt far too real to be a dream.  Suddenly a wave of clarity hits and everything becomes clear.  <i>This is the dream.</i>  You attempt to stand up, but you can’t, your arms and legs are strapped into a wheelchair.  You keep repeating to yourself, “DON’T FORGET!” trying to concentrate, vowing to stay aware. A door swings open. Your mother stands there, a permanent smile stretched upon a gaunt skeleton. “Now, now sweety. Can’t have any of that now can we. We’ve got to get ready for our stories.”  She wipes away your tears, as you struggle to remember your train of thought. What was it? It was dreadfully important. Oh well, it’ll come back to you later.<br>except it never does.</br></p>
