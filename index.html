     <h1>An empty room</h1>
   <p>You wake up in an room, empty save the bed you wake up on. Paint peels in sheets off the walls and ceiling. As you sit up, the bedsprings pop underneath as you swing your legs onto the dirty wooden floor. A single dirty window lets in a faint glow of sunlight filtered through rusted bars. Across from you, a door sits covered in locks. You stand up, dizziness drops you back down. You take another moment to gather yourself. You rub you're hands on your legs and notice something in your pockets. You reach in and pull your fist out. You open your hand and find. You stand up again, this time successfully.<br>Suddenly, the door pops open an inch.</br><br>Do you:</br></p>

     <h1>Inside</h1>
   <p>You decide to take things slowly. Perhaps getting your bearings will reaveal what brought you here in the first place. You kneel on the floor and look under the bed. Under half and inch of dust, a bronze ring shines out of the darkness. Carefully and quietly, you move the bed to reveal a giant hatch in the floor. The hinges moan slightly as you pull the hatch open. Supporting yourself, you duck your head down. A long corridor lined with bookshelves unfolds before you ending in a set of double doors. Above the doors gleams the words "exit". You hop down clumsily onto the wooden floor with a crash. You hear a commotion from the other end of the corridor; a horrible scratching, clacking sound. Suddenly, you recognize the sound as it's owner comes into sight. It's a dog. A big dog. The largest pitbull you've ever set eyes on. It slides into a bookshelf as it takes the corner, barking, jowls frothing in abject hatred. Quickly it recovers and barrels in your direction, it's eyes narrowing as it bears down upon you.<br>Should you:</br></p>

     <h1>Escape</h1>
   <p>You run. And run. And run. But no matter how much you run the dog gets closer and closer. Just as your hand reaches the door handle the dog's jowls wrap around your ankle stopping you dead in you tracks. Suddenly, it's upon you, your arms vainly flailing to protect your face. It's teeth bite into your forearms as you howl in pain. Your foot kicks out, catching the edge of a bookcase. A salvo of heavy books falls upon your attacker burying him as he exhales a sharp yelp. You slowly get up, shaking, holding your bloodied arms. Suddenly the pile of books starts to move as the beast struggles to escape it's temporary prison. You grab the handle and thrust yourself into the blinding sunlight. You feel weightless. Like you're falling. Your eyes adjust to to the light just in time to see the ground rushing up to meet you.  <br>Back to darkness.</br> The next thing you experience is pain, followed by light, and a slow  painful focus. Your hands pick up clumps of sand and bring them closer to your field of vision. You wince in shades of red as you stand up to take in your surroundings. You look up. Far above you a hundred meters, a set of doors lie ajar. You thank your lucky stars at your dumb luck. You suffer a grin, sending pain across your jawline. You attempt to take a step but your foot fails to respond, it's steadfast.  You look down. Your ankles are locked firmly in sand. Any movement sinks you deeper into the morass. It quickly swallows your knees, followed by your waist and chest. As the sand pours into your mouth and nose, a strange dormant notion surfaces as you suffocate, "Why <i>do</i> kids love cinnamon toast crunch?"</p>

     <h1>Fight</h1>
   <p>You spin around on your heels and lock eyes on the beast, crouching low.  The gap slowly closes as ripple of calm comes over you. The dog gallops towards you, a mass of sinew and tooth. As it leaps into the air, it's jagged mouth reaching for your neck's tender vulnrebilty, you fall into a trance. You slide instantly to the left, as your  left arm scoops around the beasts head. Your right palm presses upon it's shoulder just as it's momentum is about to collide.  Deftly, as one hand pulls, the other pushes, gently seperating the spinal column, and with gentle throbbing pop, a vital dislocation. You spin around channeling the creature's momentum to your side into a dusty bookcase. Reality kicks in and you start shaking. The very thought of hurting a fly sickens you, so how this?  You hear voices and footsteps from where the dog originated and rise to your feet. You run towards the exit. Just before you burst through the doors, you pull a bookcase down to potentially bar your pursuers. Pushing open the doors assaults your eyes with daylight and you blinded for a moment but you keep running regardless. Running, running, running in a world of light. Your eyes adjust just as a dark shape comes into focus. You collide. A man in a dark suit and sunglasses falls to the ground. The pistol he was holding spins on the asphalt. You both sit there on the ground for a moment, looking at each other, and than the gun between you.<br>Should you:</br></p>

     <h1>Struggle</h1>
   <p>You lunge for the pistol just as he does the same. Your fingers gently touch the barrel as his grasp for the grip.  His finger slides into the trigger guard as you fumble with the muzzle. Suddenly your eyes sharpen and time seems to slow. You legs twirl beneath you, as the leverage sends your body into the air onto the gun. Your index finger darts out, striking the magazine release. You quickly contort your body as a single shot rings out, coursing up your sleeve skinning your elbow.  The man attempts to fire off a second shot but his efforts are answered with futile clicking.
   Your other arm swings around and with an open palm strikes the center of his chest. Your arms blur as both index fingers connect behind his ears, followed by your thumbs into the sinew in his neck, as your pinkies connect just below his armpits.  His chest heaves as his head swells, blood pressure spilling out of his eyes and ears.  Like waking from a dream, you scream at what your instincts have wrought. The man is still, blood gurgling from his now deflating body.  You're brain cycles through defensive coping mechanisms that aren't available. You realize that any recollection of who you are just isn't there. A wave of nausea hits depriving your stomach of its contents. You brace yourself and slowly get up. It’s only until now that you realize you’re leaning on a car. Not just any car either, <i>thee</i> car: a 1989 jet black ferrari testarossa. You wipe your mouth with your bloodied sleeve and make your way to the driver’s side. The window is open and a set of keys and a rabbit’s foot dangle from the ignition.  For some reason you look around to see if anyone’s watching. A dormant habit from a former life perhaps? The courtyard appears empty. Suddenly, the courtyard is alive with color, as fallen leaves spin in the air heavy with the scent of the ocean. A small gap between a wall of arborvitae reveal a rusty gate that squeaks open just as the breeze quickens.

     <h1>Struggle</h1>
<p>You summon all the leverage you can and find yourself on top of the man. His hand easily grabs the pistol as he attempts to draw it’s sights towards you. Your hands pin his wrists down, but heyet manages to slowly move the barrel closer and closer.  Suddenly a shot rings out and warmth runs down your neck.  More shots ring out as you smash his hand against the ground, once, twice, three times. As his hand finally releases the pistol your other hand swings down connecting with his jaw. It puts him out. You get up and touch your right ear. Blood. But not much. Seems he grazed your ear. That’s a relief at least.  You pick up the pistol and tuck it into the front of your pants. You crouch down to check the man’s pockets, perhaps he might have some other things you might find useful. <br>Suddenly behind you!</br><br> A loud clang!</br>You spin around, gun drawn. But there’s nothing there save a rusty gate opened by the wind. You suspiciously inch towards the gate, gun ready. The gate opens to a stone stairwell, where beyond lies the endless blue expanse of the ocean. The walkway criss crosses across the stoney hillside terminating at a beach. An anchored sailboat gently bobs at it’s mooring 25 feet from the beach. <br>Should you:</br></p>

<p>You quickly hop in the car. The slam the door shut and reach for the keys. Suddenly, the pitbull lunges for the open window, it’s claws scrambling at the door. You turn the keys and the car roars to life, cramming the clutch into first as the car peels out in a cloud of burnt rubber. The dog futilely takes chase slowly becoming smaller in the rearview. You return your attention in front of you, just as you see the fast approaching gate. BAM! Too late. The car slams into the gate splitting the chain link fence in a cloud of sparks.  You continue down the straightaway, carefully listening. The car seems fine. You open her up. A valley opens up below you as you continue going faster. 80. 90. 100. 150. 200. The car responds smoothly.  You pick out a strange sound, and decide to throttle back just a little. It gets louder as the engine gets quieter.  A flapping sound? A tire perhaps? But the car continues run fair. A horror washes over you as you make a dreadful epiphany. It isn’t coming from the car. It’s coming from...Your eyes look over the dash as an attack helicopter swoops overhead to face you.  It’s starboard battery sends a ballistic missile over the drivers side missing by mere inches. You can feel the heat from the blast as the car surfs the impact wave sending the rpm up for a brief moment.<br>Should you:</br></p>

     <h1>Through the gate</h1>
<p>You swing the gate wide open and shut it carefully behind you. You run down the steps and can faintly hear more voices arriving at the top of the hill. They get louder still as they maintain their pursuit. You leap into some bushes just as three of them come within feet of your hiding place. The continue past, with machine guns drawn. You stay very, very still.<br>And this is how you remain for a day and half. Finally, at nightfall you venture out, further down the hill. Finally, a beach emerges in the clearing. The water dazzling in the moonlight.  You spy a sailboat.  A way of escape perhaps? You swim out to it, climbing the anchor chain, and flop your wet body on deck.  It seems to be empty.  You don’t know how but once again intuition takes hold. You loosen the sails and set the main. You haul up the anchor allowing the main to fill. The boat, clear of it’s moorings peels off. You set the headsails and you pick up speed. You look back to island you left behind. In the opposite direction you see the unmistakable lights of a distant city.

You look down at the man a little closer squinting at his facial features. A broken version of yours. You spring back in terror.  You quickly rise to your feet. You become aware of voices from a terrace above you. One of them spots you and points you out to the others. A shiver of fresh horror passes through you as they too share your face. They run back inside and you can hear there footsteps ringing on a metal staircase.<br>Should you:</br></p>

<p>Screw it you say to yourself and slam the pedal to the floor. The rpms spike as you shift through the gears.  The helicopter fires another missile which you quickly dodge. Even at 250 mph the vehicle responds beautifully. You blow past the chopper, as it spins around to face your back, sending a fresh salvo, all of which miss their mark, blowing craters into space you occupied just moments before.  You crouch low inthe seat peering at the helicopter in your rearview as it fades from sight.  Meanwhile the car continues to accelerate. 400. 450. 500. How is this even possible? The car hums, resonant with harmonics.  Everything around you starts brightening. 600. 650. Sparks fly as everything glows bright, red hot. 750.850. The needle buries. The hum intensifies.

It heels over to come about, but as it’s doing this, one of the blades hits a tree. The blade snaps off at the hub. Suddenly, the helicopter starts spinning out of control, landing on it’s side, it’s blades kicking up mounds of dirt. You jump out of the car to get a better look. The entire propeller breaks free from the chassis and come hurtling towards you. Time slows as the blades come at you. You have but a moment to react.

<p>You set your helm east away from civilization. You sail far far away, rarely every stopping.  But stopping, inevitably is necessary.  You drop your hook in Micronesia. You swim ashore with waterproof bags to secure supplies. At the marketplace, you use a proper restroom for the first time in years. It’s also the first time your face has seen a mirror. You do not recognize the face staring back at you. A long grizzled beard adorns your jawline. Gnarled sun bleached hair cascades down your shoulders. Your skin a leathery mask of mahogany. You leave slightly shaken. You quickly provision and move down your supply list. Months ago when you set off, an initial inventory located several million dollars in euros wrapped in plastic bags, lining the bilge. You merely had to peel a few notes off a stack and go ashore to resupply. Next, you find yourself at the chandlery to pick up some much needed engine parts. Your breath suddenly sinks in your chest as you see a poster above the register. Your former life stares back at you. A poster guaranteeing a million dollars for information leading to the capture of the president of the united states assassin.  The face on the wanted poster no longer resembles you, the sea and sun saw to that. You sigh in relief. Nobody seems to draw a distinction.  You quickly gather your purchases and return to your boat.  You quickly stow everything, pull up the anchor, and sail away…<br>Seventy years later, the french coast guard find a unmanned sailboat bobbing in the coastal waters off the Azores. They board the vessel and find your preserved body sitting up at nav table. A giant yellow grin forever emblazoned on your weathered leather face.</br>

Finally the trail of buoys end and you tie the boat up to a dock in what appears to be an industrial area.  Skyscrapers loom in the distance and you make your way towards them. You crawl through breaks in fences, giant sewer pipes, and secluded alleyways until you reach a main road littered with piles of detritus. The handlebars of a bicycle catch your eye and you pull it out of a pile of garbage. You climb on and the chain seems to hold so you start cycling along the road towards the city center. The scenery gradually transforms from industrial parks to warehouses.  A bright light flashes towards you. Headlights.  As you crane your neck back a police cruiser passes you. You lock eyes with the officer in the passenger side as it zips by.  A chill runs down your spine. A wave of familiarity without context. You can’t place the reference, but you recognize them. The car spins around a half a block ahead of you and accelerates towards you lights flashing. The bike drops from under you as you start running towards the car.

<p>Once again, some dormant training takes over as an army of familiar faces flood out of the door into the courtyard.  You fire off four shots one after another, each hitting their mark between the eyes of an imposter. One of them manages to get a shot off, as it passes harmlessly through your sleeve, as your palm connects underneath his chin stopping him in his tracks. You swap out the clip. You fire off 6 more shots, each hitting their precise mark. You check your body count: eleven. You assessed twelve. Which means...You see a thin wire flash before your eyes which gives you a split second to pull your hands up to protect yourself. A piano wire zips around your neck trapping both your hands. Your sides explode in pain, as your assailant decorates you with punches. Blood runs down your wrists as the tourniquet saws through your flesh. You squat and push your legs down and out,springing your body over and behind your attacker. A single shot rings out. The wire loosens as you land deftly behind him. He stands there in shock. A trickle of blood runs down the crown of his head as a blood stain blossoms from his crotch. You know he’s dead before he hits the ground. Thump. “Threats terminated,” an inner voice informs you. Suddenly your hear clapping from behind you. You spin around. A man dressed in what appears to be russian military dress saunters up to you applauding. Based on the amount of medals and decorations adorning his uniform, you guess he’s a higher up. An admiral, perhaps. He looks familiar but you can’t quite place it. “Отлично,” he says. Your mind automatically translates it. “Very good.” You drop your empty pistol and unconsciously settle into a taijutsu stance.<br>Should you:</br></p>

The car slowly starts sinking  into the morass as you slowly trudge out of the mud, up towards the giant holes perimeter. Something catches your eye, and a giant shape the size of a motorcycle rips right past, nearly sending you back into the pit.  You squint to attempt to make out what exactly it was. It doubles back towards you. <br>Zoom!</br>You duck just in time to miss it a second time. Yep. Exactly what you thought. A colossal dragonfly. You ready yourself for another pass, but just as it’s circling back, the earth starts shaking. It subsides as quick as it begins. The dragonfly is now nowhere to be seen. The earth shakes again and stops, sending you to your knees. Thump. It happens a third and fourth time as you watch as the top of the ferrari is consumed in mud. Thump.

<p><br>You clench your eyes shut.</br>You sit there in muted silence for what seems like an eternity until you hear a sharp rapping on the car window. You open your eyes finally, not that it does you any good, a bright light obfuscates your vision. “Are you alright ma’am?” a voice asks. The light disappears, as the police officer lowers his flashlight. You take in your surroundings.  You’re at the wheel of your car. The front end is wrapped around a pillar of an enormous gate leading to a colossal manse. The gate opens and closes  banging on the front of the vehicle. “I said, are you alright Mrs. Kardashian?” the officer asks again.  A cameraman jumps out of a nearby van.  Suddenly you’re pulled out of the vehicle. A blanket is thrown over your head and you are ushered  inside the mansion. More paparazzi arrive and the night air is alive with the flash of their cameras as the police officer tries to hold them back.  You falter a few times as you’re led up a marble staircase inside.  Finally, you are tucked into a massive bed and exhaustion takes its toll and you collapse into a deep sleep.<br>The years tick by and you grow restless. You look in the mirror at the lifeless mask before you. A lifelong addiction to plastic surgery has turned you into a hideous garish portrait of your former self.  Every once in awhile, during rare gaps in your tightly controlled itinerary, your mind takes you back.  Back to that one moment. The <i>only</i> moment where you can safely say you felt truly alive.  To this day, it still confuses you. It felt far too real to be a dream.  Suddenly a wave of clarity hits and everything becomes clear.  <i>This is the dream.</i>  You attempt to stand up, but you can’t, your arms and legs are strapped into a wheelchair.  You keep repeating to yourself, “DON’T FORGET!” trying to concentrate, vowing to stay aware. A door swings open. Your mother stands there, a permanent smile stretched upon a gaunt skeleton. “Now, now sweety. Can’t have any of that now can we. We’ve got to get ready for our stories.”  She wipes away your tears, as you struggle to remember your train of thought. What was it? It was dreadfully important. Oh well, it’ll come back to you later.<br>except it never does.</br></p>

<p>You fall to your knees as the blade comes within inches. It strikes the car, setting off an explosion that blows you back. You slowly get up, dusting yourself off, incredulous of your spate of good luck. You take an inventory of injuries.  Save a couple of scraped knees, nothing to report. You walk away from the wreckage with the certainty that whoever was hunting you, might not give up so easily.  You head into the woods. Weeks pass, you find foraging for food and water easier than you anticipated.  You started heading east, but now grow uncertain of your exact location. Everyday your legs start to ache and itch a little more. Finally, one day you happen upon a hot spring. Eagerly you start peeling your dirty clothes off, excited by the prospect of a well needed hot bath. That’s when it hits you. Your legs. The color of putrid blackish green. You prod your kneecaps and feel nothing as yellow puss pours out.  Long tendrils of black creep up from your waist all the way up your torso. How did you miss this? In your escape how could you have missed something this obvious. You collapse and catch yourself on some sort of sign. The sign is rotten at it’s base and easily twists off.  Carved into recesses and filled with yellow paint you read it: BAGBY HOT SPRINGS. Your face sits in the dirt. All the energy in your body seems to have vanished completely. You hear voices and laughter nearby. You see them. A family of four, laden with towels and backpacks pass by you a mere 5 meters. You weakly push yourself up and try to speak but nothing comes out. You collapse one more time except this time you do not rise.</p>

<p>You roll to the left as the blades narrowly miss you. Clang, clang, clang,” it sounds as it barrels into the treeline in rain of splinters and shrapnel. You peer over you shoulder as the helicopter explodes behind you. You stand up and look at what’s left of the car. It’s been completely shorn in half. As you retreat into the woods you can hear the car explode as a heat wave burns the hairs on the back of your neck.  Suddenly, the words “The End” scrolls down your field of vision. <br>“New High Score: 189,090,987.”</br><br>You grin in satisfaction as you peel off your headset and disconnect the cords tethered to your cerebral cortex.  “Honey, you’re not playing that game again? Remember what your father said. You better eat your breakfast while it’s hot. You’re going to be late for school,” your mother scolds from another bulkhead. You quickly put on your pants and glide in the air out of your room into the galley. After an hour in the game, it felt good to be free of the constraints of gravity once again. You look out at the port hole and sigh.  Planet earth glares back at you, dead and black.  What you wouldn’t give to go for a walk in the woods, any woods, one day, if ever. “Hurry up,” your mom shoves a lunchbox in your hands, “It’s your first day of second grade and I can’t have you being late.”</br>

     <h1>Run</h1>
<p>You run down the alley way as shots ring out, striking the brick inches from your head.  For every three shots, you send one back.  You keep running but the officers maintain pursuit.  Through a maze of alleyways, you end up finally  in a dead end. One officer finds cover behind a dumpster while the other flanks you from the side. You see him just before he gets a bead on you and you fire. <br>’Click’</br> Out of bullets. “Well, well, Chinanski. Should have just taken the money. You should have just had to take the money. Ah well, my sister can always remarry,” he says. “Fucking Clemens,” you’re memory finally cooperating albeit a little too late. “Although, I’m going to admit I will enjoy this juuuust a little bit,” Clemons gloats squinting at you through the sight of his service weapon. Suddenly, a little red dot appears between his eyes followed by a loud farting sound. Clemens and his partner collapse simultaneously, blood squirting from the hole in their faces. The alleyway is flooded with light as the sound of a helicopter echoes around the walls, tiny red glowing dots scouring the area for other threats. <br>Years later. You stand on the podium surrounded by your superiors. The flash of cameras from the press corps make you squint. The mayor shakes your hand and drapes a medal of honor over your shoulder. “You lured out the criminal element rife in our fair city’s police force, and practically single-handedly purged it of corruption,” he addresses the cameras. “Might need a new commissioner when I run for re-election next year,” he whispers in your ear.  Your wife gives you eyes from the other side the stage. The mayor continues his aside but the only thing you can focus on is the plunging neckline on your wife’s red dress.</p>

     <h1>Follow the lights</h1>
<p><br>You choose to stand your ground.</br>The cop car slides to a stop 5 feet from you. Two officers roll out, weapons drawn, hiding behind their doors for cover.  You think to draw your gun, but looking down, it’s already done. You train your sight upon one officer and than move it to the other. You see two little red dots trained on your heaving chest.  This is it. You’ve finally run out of runway. Well, if you’re going to go out might as well go out in a blaze of glory. The officer on the passenger side is screaming something you can’t quite make out, “Gottawitchprick.” Your index finger begins to squeeze the trigger. You squint as he lowers his weapon, the other gun still trained on your vitals. “Jabbabitchwick,” he howls at you cupping his hands. You square your shoulders, steady your resolve and prepare your shot. <br>“Chappaquiddick!”</br><br>All of a sudden the floor falls from under you and body drains of all energy and you collapse and darkness.</br>You awaken strapped into a hospital bed. “Jesus Kerrrist, Chinanski. You really had us going for a second there,” says the officer from before. His badge reads “Clemens.”  Wait you know that name? You’re sisters husband? You have a sister! Suddenly, everything comes back. The deep cover assignment. The intense psychological training and hypnosis you went through to successfully implant yourself in the Mako cartel without detection. The assassinations of their key players completely off the record. Your eventual capture and escape. “Thank god, for that safeword. I’d never forgive myself if I’d taken a shot at the best man at my wedding!” Clemens beams at you. “Good to see you buddy boy, somebody here who wants to talk to you,” he says exchanging glances with the police commissioner walks in. “You saved alot of lives, Chinanski and you deserve our highest commendations,” the commissioner lauds, fluffing a pillow. “Unfortunately, what happens in the shadows should probably stay in the shadows,” he dryly states moving the pillow towards your head.<br>”Chappaquiddick.”</br></p>

     <h1>Attack</h1>
<p>You’ve had enough of these games. Your hands fall to you sides, flat. You can hear your heart beating in your ears. Suddenly your hands flash up like twin blades striking the general on both sides of his neck. You hear a snap as you palms separate the axis from the atlas vertebrae. He folds into a heap of stiff fabric and clanging medals. “ебать тебя,” he spits at you. “Увидимся в аду!” he rasps just before the light evaporates from his eyes. You shrug, no longer appalled by your actions. You matter of factly survey the extent of the carnage you wrought and find yourself devoid of guilt. As your adrenaline subsides, what he said catches up with you.<br> See. You. In. Hell.</br> You crouch beside your “comrade” and turn his body over. Clutched in his left hand, a remote detonator. His thumb permantantly clamped on the the glowing green trigger. “Ohhhh, Sheeeeyyyiiiiittt,” is the last words that escape your mouth before you and everything around you is engulfed in a giant mushroom cloud.

     <h1>I'm listening...</h1>
<p>Enough bloodshed!  You drop your weapon and walk closer to the officer. “Congratulations USD.79-13!” he reaches up and squeezes your shoulders. Your look of confusion encourages him to extrapolate.  He explains, “You are the final product of many years of research. Uber Soldat-79. Mother russia’s supersoldier protocol. You just passed the test by dispatching your 13 clones.  We’ve been waiting to meet you for a very long time. Walk with me...” Finally, it clicks. You know him. Vladimir Putin himself, in the flesh. And you know who are, or at least whom you resemble. The patchy orange skin. The shitty white/blonde combover. The doughy pear shaped body. The ill fitting suits. The micro-penis… The two of you walk back inside as Putie (can I call you Putie?) details your “Glorious Destiny.”<br>A year passes.</br>The final vote is in. Four more years! You retreat from you’re yuge party for another bathroom break. Everyone knows you have a bladder the size of an infant so it fails to arouse suspicion. The dulcet sounds of three doors down’s “Superman” dims as the door closes. You empty a handful of human fingers out of your pockets into the toilet and flush them. The final evidence tying you to your predecessor now no longer exists.  You walk out, singular, beaming like the shit eating orangutan you are. You just can’t wait to get out there and show em how to make America Great. <br>Again.</br></p>
